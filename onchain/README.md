# Stellopay Core – On-Chain Contracts

![Contracts CI](https://github.com/Stellopay/stellopay-core/actions/workflows/contracts.yml/badge.svg)

A decentralized payroll and agreement system built on the [Stellar](https://stellar.org) blockchain using [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org). This workspace contains **28 smart contracts** plus integration tests, covering payroll escrows, salary disbursement, multi-currency swaps, governance, compliance, and more.

| Toolchain | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| Soroban SDK | `23.4.1` (pinned in workspace `Cargo.toml`) |
| Stellar CLI | Latest stable (`cargo install stellar-cli --locked`) |
| WASM target | `wasm32-unknown-unknown` |
| Rust | Stable channel |

---

## Prerequisites

Install the Rust toolchain, the WASM compilation target, and the Stellar CLI:

```bash
# 1. Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup install stable

# 2. Add the WASM compilation target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# 3. Install the Stellar CLI
cargo install stellar-cli --locked
```

> **Note:** CI (`.github/workflows/contracts.yml`) uses exactly these steps. See [docs/ci.md](../docs/ci.md) for the full pipeline.

### Batch Size Ceiling

All public batch entrypoints are capped by `storage::MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (`20` items):
`batch_claim_payroll`, `batch_claim_milestones`,
`batch_create_payroll_agreements`, and `batch_create_escrow_agreements`.
Oversized batches fail before item processing with `PayrollError::BatchTooLarge`.

The ceiling is tied to `onchain/contracts/stello_pay_contract/tests/gas_benchmarks.rs`,
which records the cost of `batch_claim_milestones` at the max size and asserts it
stays under the documented instruction threshold. Run:

```sh
cargo test -p stello_pay_contract gas_benchmark -- --nocapture
```

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Stellopay/stellopay-core.git
cd stellopay-core/onchain
```

---

## Building

### Build a specific contract (WASM)

```bash
cd contracts/stello_pay_contract
stellar contract build --verbose
```

`stellar contract build` automatically targets `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and applies the workspace release profile. See [docs/build-targets.md](../docs/build-targets.md) for why this target is required.

### Build all contracts

```bash
# From onchain/
for dir in contracts/*/; do
  (cd "$dir" && stellar contract build --verbose 2>/dev/null) || true
done
```

---

## Testing

### Run all workspace tests

```bash
# From onchain/
cargo test --workspace
```

### Run tests for a specific package

```bash
cargo test -p stello_pay_contract --verbose
cargo test -p integration_tests --verbose
cargo test -p template_versioning --verbose
```

### Run a specific test

```bash
cargo test -p stello_pay_contract test_payroll
cargo test -p stello_pay_contract test_create_or_update_escrow
```

Test snapshots are automatically generated in each contract's `test_snapshots` directory when tests run. These ensure contract behavior remains consistent across changes.

---

## Contract Inventory

All contracts live under `onchain/contracts/`. The workspace member glob `contracts/*` includes them all.

## Coverage

Generate code coverage reports locally:

```bash
# Install coverage tooling (one-time)
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov

# Generate HTML coverage report
cd onchain
cargo llvm-cov test -p stello_pay_contract -p integration_tests --html

# Generate Codecov-compatible JSON
cargo llvm-cov test -p stello_pay_contract -p integration_tests --codecov --output-path codecov.json
```

CI uploads coverage to [Codecov](https://codecov.io) automatically. See [docs/ci.md](../docs/ci.md) for details.

---

## Benchmarks

Soroban cost benchmarks measure host resource usage for critical contract paths:

```bash
cd contracts/stello_pay_contract
cargo bench --bench critical_paths
```

CI compiles every bench target on each pull request without running it:

```bash
cd onchain
cargo build --workspace --benches --verbose
```

The benchmarks themselves run on a schedule or on demand in
[`.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml`](./.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml), which uploads the
results as the `benchmark-results` artifact.

See [docs/benchmarks.md](../docs/benchmarks.md) for interpreting results and regression guarding.

---

## Release Profile

The workspace defines a production release profile in [`onchain/Cargo.toml`](./Cargo.toml) optimized for minimal WASM size and deterministic builds:

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"        # Optimize for size
debug = 0              # No debug info
strip = "symbols"      # Strip symbols
debug-assertions = false
overflow-checks = true # Keep overflow safety
lto = true             # Link-time optimization
panic = "abort"        # Abort on panic (no unwinding)
codegen-units = 1      # Single codegen unit for max optimization
```

A `release-with-logs` variant inherits all settings but re-enables `debug-assertions` for diagnostic builds.

> **Security note:** All production WASM artifacts must be built with this profile to ensure reproducible, deployment-safe binaries. Using different flags risks non-reproducible artifacts that may behave differently on-network.

---

## Building on Windows

If you see **"export ordinal too large"** when running `cargo test` or `cargo build` with the GNU/MinGW toolchain, use the WASM-only build approach:

```powershell
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cd onchain\contracts\stello_pay_contract
cargo build -p stello_pay_contract --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

Run tests in WSL or rely on CI. See [docs/windows-build.md](../docs/windows-build.md) for full instructions (Option A: MSVC, Option B: GNU + WSL).

---
