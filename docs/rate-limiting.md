# Rate Limiting Contract

## Overview

The rate limiter enforces per-address quotas over a configurable time window to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. It provides:
- Configurable default and per-address limits
- Automatic window reset based on ledger timestamp
- Admin-controlled explicit resets and configuration updates
- NatSpec-style documentation in the contract

Location: `onchain/contracts/rate_limiter`

## Data Model

- Admin: Address authorized to modify configuration.
- DefaultLimit (u32): Global limit per window.
- WindowSeconds (u64): Window duration.
- Limit(Address → u32): Optional per-address override.
- Usage(Address → { count: u32, window_start: u64 }): Current usage within the active window.

## API

- initialize(admin, default_limit, window_seconds)
- get_admin() → Option<Address>
- get_default_limit() → u32
- set_default_limit(limit)
- get_window_seconds() → u64
- set_window_seconds(seconds)
- set_limit_for(addr, limit)
- clear_limit_for(addr)
- get_limit_for(addr) → u32
- get_usage(addr) → Usage
- check_and_consume(subject) → Result<ConsumptionOutcome, RateLimitError>
- reset_usage(addr)

## Outcome and Exhaustion

`check_and_consume` returns a typed result rather than a bare integer:

- `Ok(ConsumptionOutcome { remaining, refill_in_seconds })` — the call was served.
  `remaining` is the subject's allowance after the call and `refill_in_seconds` is
  how long until the bucket next holds a token (`Some(0)` now, `Some(1)` on the next
  whole-second tick, `None` when the refill rate is `0`).
- `Err(RateLimitError::RateLimitExceeded)` — at least one enforced bucket was empty,
  so nothing was debited.

Exhaustion is therefore never signalled by a `0` return value: a served call that
leaves `remaining == 0` is `Ok`, and only an empty bucket is `Err`. Callers that need
to branch on the failure must use `try_check_and_consume`.


## Security Model

- Only the stored admin can modify configuration or reset usage; admin must authenticate.
- Subjects must authenticate to consume quota, preventing arbitrary penalization by others.
- Window reset uses ledger timestamp; tests mock time via `Env::ledger()`.
- All counters use saturating arithmetic and bounds checks to avoid overflow.

## Testing

Comprehensive tests live in `onchain/contracts/rate_limiter/tests/test_rate_limit.rs` and cover:
- Initialization and configuration updates
- Per-address overrides and fallback to default
- Consumption within limit and rejection beyond limit
- Automatic window reset at boundary
- Admin reset and security assumptions
- Edge cases (e.g., zero default limit)

## Usage Notes

- Set sensible defaults and overrides for high-traffic addresses.
- The `stello_pay_contract` optionally integrates this rate limiter to protect its `claim_payroll`, `claim_payroll_in_token`, and `batch_claim_payroll` entrypoints from spam. When configured via `set_rate_limiter_contract`, these endpoints call `check_and_consume` and return `RateLimited` if the caller's quota is exhausted.
- For auditability, emit events if you need operational telemetry. (Current minimal version omits events.)
